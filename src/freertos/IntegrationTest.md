# FreeRTOS Integration Test Guide

This guide helps you verify that the FreeRTOS integration is working correctly.

## What We've Integrated

### ✅ **FreeRTOS Logging System**
- **SDWriterTask**: Background task that writes logs to SD card
- **LogManager**: Global logging interface with macros (LOG_INFO, LOG_ERROR, etc.)
- **Queue-based**: Non-blocking log message queuing

### ✅ **FreeRTOS LED Update Task**
- **LEDUpdateTask**: High-priority task on Core 1 for LED pattern updates
- **60 FPS**: Runs at ~60 FPS (16ms intervals)
- **Pattern rendering**: Handles all LED pattern calculations and FastLED.show()
- **Button processing**: Processes button events for pattern changes

### ✅ **FreeRTOS System Monitor**
- **SystemMonitorTask**: Monitors system health every 15 seconds
- **Heap monitoring**: Tracks memory usage
- **Task monitoring**: Checks if all tasks are running

## How to Test

### 1. **Compile and Upload**
```bash
# Build and upload your firmware
pio run -t upload
```

### 2. **Check Serial Output**
You should see:
```
[Main] Initializing FreeRTOS logging system...
[Main] FreeRTOS logging system started
[Main] Initializing FreeRTOS LED update task...
[Main] FreeRTOS LED update task started
[Main] Initializing FreeRTOS system monitor task...
[Main] FreeRTOS system monitor task started
[FreeRTOS] FreeRTOS logging system initialized
[FreeRTOS] System started at: 1234 ms
[FreeRTOS] SD card available: yes
[FreeRTOS] FreeRTOS LED update task started
[FreeRTOS] FreeRTOS system monitor task started
```

### 3. **Check LED Behavior**
- LEDs should continue to work exactly as before
- Pattern changes should be smooth and responsive
- Button presses should still change patterns

### 4. **Check Logging**
- Look for log messages in the serial output
- Check that logs are being written to `/logs/srdriver.log` on the SD card
- Monitor the log queue status in the serial output every 5 seconds

### 5. **Monitor Task Status**
Every 5 seconds, you should see:
```
[FreeRTOS] FreeRTOS Log Queue - Items: 0, Available: 32
[FreeRTOS] LED Update - Frames: 312, Interval: 16 ms
[FreeRTOS] Legacy Log Queue - Items: 0, Task active: 1
```

## Expected Benefits

### ✅ **Non-Blocking Operations**
- LED updates no longer block the main loop
- Log writing happens in background
- System remains responsive during file operations

### ✅ **Better Performance**
- LED updates run on dedicated core (Core 1)
- Logging doesn't interfere with LED rendering
- System monitoring runs independently

### ✅ **Improved Reliability**
- Task monitoring detects if tasks stop unexpectedly
- Automatic log buffering prevents data loss
- Better error handling and reporting

## Troubleshooting

### **LEDs not working?**
- Check that the FreeRTOS LED task started successfully
- Verify the old TaskScheduler LED task is disabled
- Check serial output for LED task errors

### **Logs not appearing?**
- Verify SD card is initialized before FreeRTOS tasks
- Check that `/logs/` directory exists on SD card
- Monitor log queue status in serial output

### **System seems slower?**
- LED task runs on Core 1 (shouldn't affect main loop)
- Logging task runs on Core 0 (may affect WiFi/BLE slightly)
- Monitor task priorities and adjust if needed

### **Memory issues?**
- Check heap usage in system monitor output
- Reduce stack sizes if needed
- Monitor task memory usage

## Next Steps

Once this integration is working:

1. **Replace more logging calls** throughout your codebase
2. **Create BLE task** to move BLE handling to FreeRTOS
3. **Add more file operations** using the SD writer task
4. **Optimize task priorities** based on performance monitoring
5. **Remove old TaskScheduler tasks** as you migrate to FreeRTOS

## Performance Monitoring

The system monitor task will log:
- Heap usage and memory status
- Task queue status
- System uptime and health metrics

Watch for:
- **High queue usage**: Indicates tasks are falling behind
- **Low heap**: May need to reduce stack sizes
- **Task failures**: Tasks stopping unexpectedly

## Migration Path

This integration provides a **gradual migration path**:

1. **Phase 1**: ✅ Logging system (complete)
2. **Phase 2**: ✅ LED updates (complete)
3. **Phase 3**: BLE handling (next)
4. **Phase 4**: File operations (next)
5. **Phase 5**: Remove old TaskScheduler (final)

Your existing code continues to work while you gradually move to FreeRTOS!

### **Basic Task Creation**

```cpp
// Create a custom task
class MyCustomTask : public SRTask {
public:
    MyCustomTask() : SRTask("MyTask", 4096, tskIDLE_PRIORITY + 1, 0) {}
    
protected:
    void run() override {
        LOG_INFO("My custom task started");
        
        TickType_t lastWakeTime = xTaskGetTickCount();
        
        while (true) {
            // Your task logic here
            processData();
            
            // Sleep until next cycle (100ms)
            SRTask::sleepUntil(&lastWakeTime, 100);
        }
    }
};
```

### **Inter-Task Communication**

```cpp
// Create a queue for task communication
SRQueue<String> messageQueue(10, "MessageQueue");

// Task 1: Send messages
void sendMessage(const String& msg) {
    messageQueue.send(msg);
}

// Task 2: Receive messages
String receiveMessage() {
    String msg;
    if (messageQueue.receive(msg, 1000)) { // 1 second timeout
        LOG_INFO("Received: " + msg);
    }
    return msg;
}
```

### **Logging Throughout Your Code**

```cpp
// Replace Serial.println with structured logging
LOG_INFO("Application started");
LOG_DEBUG("Processing data: " + String(dataValue));
LOG_WARN("Low memory condition detected");
LOG_ERROR("Failed to connect to device");

// Formatted logging
LOG_PRINTF("Temperature: %dÂ°C, Humidity: %.1f%%", temp, humidity);
